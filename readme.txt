== Description ==
ArrowChat is a Facebook style chat plugin. It works well, and is a great addition to sites looking for a social solution. Similar to Wibiya, the Meebo toolbar and CometChat, Arrowchat functions independently from WordPress, which means that the user must install it. This plugin makes installation much easier and more streamlined by circumventing the process of having to modify theme files.

== Installation ==
1. Download component source code and unzip it.
2. Upload "ArrowChat WordPress Integration" directory into WordPress plugins directory i.e. "wp-content/plugins".
4. Go to "Dashboard >> Plugins" menu and activate "ArrowChat WordPress Integration".
5. Go to "Dashboard >> Settings >> ArrowChat" and enter in your ArrowChat header and footer code (you get this after installing ArrowChat).
